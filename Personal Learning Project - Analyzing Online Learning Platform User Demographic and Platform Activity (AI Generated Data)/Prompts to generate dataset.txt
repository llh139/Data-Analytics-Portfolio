I want to analyze the customer demographics and the platform active seasonality for an online learning platform, therefore I need at least 2 datasets, one for customers information, another for platform visit log.

For customer information, include: user id, first name, last name, email, age, occupation, and nationality. Guideline for columns:
- Include numbers and alphabets in user id,
- Use first name/last name/both with numbers in email
- Limit the age between 15 and 55
- More professional worker than students
- If age is less than 19, occupation = student
- If age is more than 25, occupation cannot be student

For platform visit log, include: date, entry time, exit time, device, and user id. Guideline for columns:
- The data record will be for a year (January to December), sorted by date then entry time in ascending order
- Exit time is after the entry time, and the time is not between 1 am and 7 am
- More data recorded at night
- More data recorded for Saturday and Sunday if you can identify the day of week from the date 
- The data show a little rise in activity during school holiday

Make the datasets needed to be manipulated and cleaned.
